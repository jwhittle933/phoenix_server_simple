Discuss List Application
==========================

Demo app from Udemy Elixir/Phonix course.  

To grab this repo as boilerplate
  * `git clone https://github.com/jwhittle933/phoenix_server_simple.git`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Phoenix can be used with any SQL server, but the project as is uses postgres. To get postgres on your machine (if you don't already have it), run `brew update`, then `brew install postgres`. 
  * Read [this](http://exponential.io/blog/2015/02/21/install-postgresql-on-mac-os-x-via-brew/) page to make sure postgres is ready to go. 
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`. 
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`. This will launch the application as made. See below for instructions on how to strip this project to bare bones. 

You can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
